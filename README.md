# Hi, I'm Satyajit (Chris)!
### Astrophysics Student at Rutgers University | Researching the Application of Machine Learning in Gravitational Lens Modeling

- 🔭 I’m currently reading through [the Mathematics of Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.04807) and reviewing [3Blue1Brown's Neural Network Guide](https://www.3blue1brown.com/lessons/backpropagation), while working on my [Projectile Motion Neural Network](https://github.com/satyajitlion/Projectile_Motion_Network).
- 🗩 Talk to me about **Python**, **Neural Networks**, **Astronomy**, or **Music**.
- 👨🏻‍🔬 Check out some of my [previous projects](https://github.com/satyajitlion/PhysicsSimulations)!
