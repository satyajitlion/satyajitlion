# Hi, I'm Chris (Satyajit)!

### Astrophysics Student at Rutgers University studying Gravitational Lensing
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently reading through <em><a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.04807">the Mathematics of Neural Networks</a></em> while working on my <em><a href=\"https://github.com/satyajitlion/Projectile_Motion_Network">Projectile Motion Neural Network</a></em>. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: Computation is one of my favorite aspects of Astrophysics! As such, I'm a Data Science fanatic.
