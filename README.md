# Hi, I'm Chris (Satyajit)!

##### 🔭 I’m currently working on my Projectile Motion Neural Network project, Gravitational Lensing Research, and my personal website. 

##### 🌱 I’m in the process of understanding the math behind backpropagation.

##### ⚡ Fun fact: Computation is one of my favorite aspects of Astrophysics! As such, I'm a Data Science fanatic.
