# Hi, I'm Chris (Satyajit)!
<p>
  ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my Projectile Motion Neural Network project, Gravitational Lensing Research, and my personal website. <br>
  ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m in the process of understanding the math behind backpropagation. <br>
  âš¡ Fun fact: Computation is one of my favorite aspects of Astrophysics! As such, I'm a Data Science fanatic.
