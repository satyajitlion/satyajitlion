# Hi, I'm Chris (Satyajit)!

### Astrophysics Student at Rutgers University studying Gravitational Lensing
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently reading through [the Mathematics of Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.04807) while working on my [Projectile Motion Neural Network](https://github.com/satyajitlion/Projectile_Motion_Network). 
- âš¡ Fun fact: Computation is one of my favorite aspects of Astrophysics! As such, I'm a Data Science fanatic.
